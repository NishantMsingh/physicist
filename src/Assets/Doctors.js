    brief:`Hello! I’m Priyanka , an expressive arts therapy practitioner and an artist! 
    I use the client centered approach in my therapy , where I guide the clients into taking the creative tools of expressive arts as a medium of expression and channelisation for their emotions. 
    Expressing and relieving one’s feelings can lead to wellness and healing  - overall. And sometimes a lot of trauma, grief, emotions can get stuck in our bodies and our subconscious. 
    The creative arts can become a guiding force for this relief and awareness! `,
    specification:`I am Queer affirmative and Trauma informed in my training as well. 
    I have also completed my training in Music in wellness from Berklee college of music. `
